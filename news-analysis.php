        <h1>PitchBook News & Analysis</h1>
          <article>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Along with its Private Equity and Venture Capital data analytics platform, PitchBook produces a wealth of editorial content including monthly PE/VC industry reports, a blog, videos and a daily newsletter with a readership of 200,000.</p>
            <p>While working to determine an overall site architecture and content strategy as part of a corporate website redesign, I noticed that all of PitchBook’s editorial content is spread throughout disparate and isolated channels. Our blog is on one site, PitchBook TV (our video content outlet) is on another site, our reports are released on our corporate website, daily newsletter are distributed via email and never the four shall meet. Talk about unrealized brand and SEO potential!</p>
            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>After conducting competitive research to see how similar companies distribute their editorial content, it became clear that PitchBook has a serious competitive advantage in the breadth and depth of the content it publishes. I developed a proposal for PitchBook News & Analysis: a hub for all our content that will establish us as an authority and thought leader in PE/VC industry, like Bloomberg, VentureBeat or PEHub.</p>
            <p>In the proposal I tried to keep in mind which of our content sources are the highest converting, and plan a strategy for showing related and sidebar content accordingly.</p>
