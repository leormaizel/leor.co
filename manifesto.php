          <h3>There’s no denying that things have changed.</h3>
          <p>People have more access to technology than ever before. Devices with computing power unfathomable 30 years ago now fit in our pocket. The internet, mobile applications, and soon biometric and augmented reality devices in our homes and on our bodies are the substratum upon which we carry out our daily lives, conduct business and socialize with other human beings.</p>
          <p>As a result, core attitudes, assumptions, and routines that inextricably governed our lives are now irrevocably changed—the way we share information about ourselves is different. The way we expect to meet people is different. The way we have becomed accustomed to consume and retain information is different.</p>
          <p>This unprecedentedly rapid disruption has given way to a renaissance in the ways we interact with digital objects.</p>
          <p>In the last few years the idea has taken root that digital products and experiences should not only be of high performance and technical craftsmanship, but that they should be something beyond the utilitarian––visually appealing, intuitive, even fun. Advances in web technology have allowed us to create powerful, immersive and engaging experiences like never before. From the knowledge that technological complexity must be managed, an entire industry––User Experience Design––has been born and accepted into the highest echelons of corporate organizational structures.</p>
          <h3>But User Experience Design faces a dilemma.</h3>
          <p>As designers, our role is to create digital products that add positive value in people’s lives. But what price have we paid?</p>
          <p>The more we create digital products that seek to enhance real physical experiences, the greater the risk that we begin to devalue the simple, core and real experiences that define what it is to be human.</p>
          <h3>What are we, as a modern technologically advanced society, sacrificing?</h3>

          <p>We as designers have a responsibility. If we feel that that something real, vulnerable and inherently human is weakening, we can not excuse ourselves as passive agents. We design these products. We must address their consequences.</p>
          <p>Let us as an industry seek to design tools that help users carry out their daily tasks so they can get back to the business of human interaction. Let us always keep a watchful eye on whether our products encourage or discourage real social connections.</p>
          <h3>And let us continually strive to find a happy medium.</h3>
